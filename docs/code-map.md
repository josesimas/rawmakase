# Code map

Use this page to find an implementation or decide where a change belongs. Read
[architecture.md](architecture.md) for ownership rules, concurrency invariants and
compatibility constraints. Paths below are relative to this document and clickable.
Module roots (`mod.rs`) define their public API; implementation helpers generally
remain private to their domain. This is one Rust package, not a multi-crate workspace.

## Entry points and native boundary

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| [src/main.rs](../src/main.rs) | CLI argument parsing and command dispatch; starts the desktop application when no subcommand is selected. |

| [src/raw/mod.rs](../src/raw/mod.rs) | RAW files as RAWmakase sees them: metadata (with DNG, RAF and lens details read on top), development into camera-space images, oriented embedded thumbnails. No unsafe code. |
| [src/raw/ffi.rs](../src/raw/ffi.rs) | The C ABI of the native bridge: declarations, the mirrored metadata struct with its layout check, and one safe wrapper per entry point with its safety contract. |

| [src/jpeg.rs](../src/jpeg.rs) | Walks a JPEG's marker segments up to the image data: embedded XMP and EXIF, and where an export inserts its XMP. |
| [src/exif.rs](../src/exif.rs) | The camera's own EXIF read from a RAW, JPEG or TIFF (for exports, capture times and photo info), and the names of the EXIF, TIFF and GPS tags RAWmakase uses; maker notes and offsets into the RAW are left out. |
| [src/stats.rs](../src/stats.rs) | The opt-in weekly usage report: what it holds, how the install channel and platform are found, and sending it at most once a week ([usage-stats.md](usage-stats.md)). Built only with the default `telemetry` feature. |
| [src/time.rs](../src/time.rs) | Calendar dates and ISO weeks from Unix time, without a date library. |
| [src/updates.rs](../src/updates.rs) | Release checks against GitHub, whether this install may replace itself, and the signed download and install (through fastframe-update). |
| [src/platform/mod.rs](../src/platform/mod.rs), [network.rs](../src/platform/network.rs), [volume.rs](../src/platform/volume.rs), [reveal.rs](../src/platform/reveal.rs), [web.rs](../src/platform/web.rs) | OS integration: Linux GVFS/FUSE path bridge, which drive a path is on, showing a file in the file manager, opening web pages. |

| [lens/choice.rs](../src/lens/choice.rs) | Lightroom's lens profile Setup (Default, Auto, Custom), the profile an edit names, which one renders, and the Make/Model/Profile menus. |

## XMP and presets

XMP translates Adobe settings into a validated recipe. Presets manage reusable
recipes and the installed preset collection; they do not own the renderer.

| File | Responsibility |

| [builtin.rs](../src/presets/builtin.rs) | Built-in presets embedded from `assets/presets`, their group order and ids. |
| [library.rs](../src/presets/library.rs) | XMP collection discovery, import without overwriting existing files, display names and favorites. |

| [sidecar.rs](../src/storage/sidecar.rs) | Edits saved beside photos before editing moved into the Library: validated and imported into the catalog, with their spots and masks from the companion `*.rawmakase-local.json`, when their folder is added; also read by the CLI's `render`. The library API can still write them. |
| [session.rs](../src/storage/session.rs) | Last-opened path, monitor profile, raw defaults and other preferences. |
| [catalog/mod.rs](../src/catalog/mod.rs) | Owns the database connection: catalog lifecycle, browsing queries (photos, folders, collections, roots), metadata and relinking. |
| [catalog/db.rs](../src/catalog/db.rs) | `Db`, the connection behind a catalog, SQLite or PostgreSQL: one API (`?` placeholders, `RETURNING id`, transactions and savepoints), PostgreSQL's translation, type adaptation and reconnect. Catalog SQL is written once, in the dialect both understand. |
| [catalog/server.rs](../src/catalog/server.rs) | The PostgreSQL catalog: connection details and their saved `catalog-server.json` (Preferences > Catalog), the `postgres://user@host:port/database` identity that `Catalog::open` accepts, and creating or checking its tables. |
| [catalog/migrate.rs](../src/catalog/migrate.rs) | Copying a local catalog into an empty server catalog (binary `COPY`, ids kept), and Lightroom import onto the server by way of a temporary local catalog. |

| [models.rs](../src/catalog/models.rs) | Folder, photo, collection and saved-edit records crossing the catalog API. |
| [schema.sql](../src/catalog/schema.sql) | Every catalog table, idempotent: run on creation and on every open, so older catalogs gain tables added since. |
| [schema_pg.sql](../src/catalog/schema_pg.sql) | The same tables for PostgreSQL. Keep the two in step; raise `SCHEMA_REVISION` in `server.rs` when it gains a table. |
| [preview_cache.rs](../src/catalog/preview_cache.rs) | Separate, disposable SQLite JPEG cache with identity checks, offline hits and a size budget. |
| [lightroom/mod.rs](../src/catalog/lightroom/mod.rs) | Read-only Lightroom snapshot import, source preservation, relational transfer and atomic destination publication. |
| [lightroom/develop.rs](../src/catalog/lightroom/develop.rs) | Parses Lightroom's serialized Lua settings as data, translates supported controls through XMP, and reports unsupported settings. Never executes Lua. |
| [lightroom/history.rs](../src/catalog/lightroom/history.rs) | Lightroom's develop history per photo, and its recovery from the preserved .lrcat for catalogs imported before it was kept. |

| [export/encode.rs](../src/export/encode.rs) | JPEG and 16-bit TIFF encoding with the ICC profile, EXIF directories and XMP. |
| [export/metadata.rs](../src/export/metadata.rs), [export/exif.rs](../src/export/exif.rs) | The EXIF directories an export writes (the camera's, with the export's size, orientation, resolution and software), as a JPEG's TIFF block. |
| [export/job.rs](../src/export/job.rs) | One photo's export from start to finish: decode when needed, render, metadata, file. |
| [export/settings.rs](../src/export/settings.rs) | The Export dialog's choices (destination, name, format, size, metadata), saved as `export.json` for the next export. |

## Desktop application

The desktop owns interaction and task coordination. Panels use the domain APIs
above rather than implementing SQL, file formats or pixel processing.

### Background work

| File | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| [worker/mod.rs](../src/app/worker/mod.rs) | Named event payloads, load/render jobs, task kinds, render stages and repaint notification. |
| [worker/latest.rs](../src/app/worker/latest.rs) | Single-slot mailbox: submitting a new job replaces pending work rather than growing a queue; optional lanes each keep their own latest job. A panicking job does not end the thread. |
| [worker/loader.rs](../src/app/worker/loader.rs) | RAW metadata and profile loading, embedded preview, the half-size then full decoded image and neighboring thumbnails. |
| [worker/reference.rs](../src/app/worker/reference.rs) | Develops Reference View's photo with its catalog edit on its own thread: half size first for Fit, then in full (through the decode cache) for 100%. |
| [worker/renderer.rs](../src/app/worker/renderer.rs) | Fit previews, reduced-then-full 100% regions, cancellation, monitor conversion and clipping overlays, for the edit and, in its own lane with its own caches and textures, Before beside it. After a panic it reports the job failed and rebuilds all of its state. |

## How an operation moves through the app

1. **Open a photo:** workspace/dialog/catalog actions enter `app::workflow`. It
   flushes the old document, resets document state, starts a load generation and
   submits a loader job. The loader uses `raw`, `camera_profiles` and `storage`.
   `app::events` accepts only current results. A saved catalog recipe, when present,
   replaces the loader's resolved defaults for a catalog photo.
2. **Edit and preview:** panels change the recipe. `app::editing` and `history`
   group the change; save policy marks it pending. `workflow` submits the effective
   recipe and viewport to the renderer. The worker calls `develop`; with a usable
   GPU and a recipe the GPU stage covers (engine 4 with the reference flags, see
   `pipeline/pixel_params.rs`), the color and tone stage and the finishing run on
   the device and the result is drawn straight from its texture; otherwise the
   worker renders on the CPU and prepares the display bytes. Accepted results
   become the preview. At 100%, an edit or pan whose region is not already cached
   and takes more than a moment publishes a reduced draft first, then the
   full-resolution region.
3. **Save edits:** workspace autosave and navigation/close flushing call
   `workflow`; autosave writes in the background (`autosave`), and flushing
   waits for it before saving synchronously. Photos are edited only through the
   Library, so edits always save through `catalog`. An edit the catalog cannot load
   is protected and cannot autosave, and failed writes remain pending for retry. Presets are separately saved reusable recipes.
4. **Export:** foreground activity coordinates destination/overwrite handling.
   The export job captures the recipe, renders through the development API, then
   calls `export` to encode and publish. Output embeds sRGB independently of the
   monitor profile. Navigation is held during export.
5. **Apply a preset:** `presets` discovers assets, `xmp` parses/translates Adobe
   settings, and the app handles compatibility and hover state. Hover is temporary;
   application commits a recipe through the editing/history flow.
6. **Import Lightroom:** the app or CLI calls `catalog::lightroom`. It reads a
   source snapshot, preserves source data, transfers relationships, and publishes
   a new native catalog. Develop translation is best effort and reports unsupported
   settings; it does not promise Lightroom rendering parity.

## Where data lives

`storage::data_dir()` selects `RAWMAKASE_DATA_DIR` when set. Otherwise it uses
`~/Library/Application Support/RAWmakase` on macOS and `$XDG_DATA_HOME/rawmakase`
(default `~/.local/share/rawmakase`) on Linux.

| Data | Location and lifetime |
| --- | --- |
| Original RAW and Lightroom catalog | User-selected source files; treated as read-only. |
| Legacy sidecar edits | Adjacent `photo.ARW.rawmakase.json` / `photo.RAF.rawmakase.json`, plus `photo.ARW.rawmakase-local.json` for spots and masks, or identity-keyed JSON under the data directory's `sidecars/`, saved by releases before 0.1.8. Imported into the catalog when their folder is added and left on disk unchanged. |
| Native catalog | User-selected `.rawmakase` SQLite file; authoritative catalog metadata, edits and preserved import data. Spots, red eye corrections and masks are in the `local_edits` table, Develop History in `develop_history`, raster data in `bitmaps`. |
| Native preset / exported photo | User-selected JSON / JPEG / TIFF destination. |
| Session preferences | `session.json` in the data directory; last path and monitor ICC path. UI tests inject a temporary destination or disable writes. |
| Preset favorites | `preset-favorites.json` in the data directory. |
| Saved point curves | `curves/` in the data directory: one XMP file per curve, named by the curve. |
| Installed assets | `xmp-presets/` and `camera-profiles/` under asset roots; shared discovery also checks the legacy XDG/Linux data location. Imported XMP files go to `xmp-presets/Imported/` under the current data directory. |
| Library previews | `previews.sqlite3` in the data directory; disposable cache, not a source of edits. |
| Decoded photos | `decoded/` in the cache directory (`~/Library/Caches/RAWmakase` on macOS, `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/rawmakase`, default `~/.cache/rawmakase`, on Linux; `RAWMAKASE_CACHE_DIR` overrides it): developed camera images of opened and prefetched photos, capped at 4 GB, least recently used removed first. Disposable. |
| Build output | `target/`; generated binaries, documentation and local macOS bundle. |

## Tests and reference tools

Most unit tests live alongside their implementation, either inline or in a
sibling `tests.rs`. Keep regressions with the domain that owns the behavior.

| [examples/preview_benchmark.rs](../examples/preview_benchmark.rs) | Read-only release benchmark of first Fit, slider Fit, 100% region and export renders on a supplied RAW; checks Fit against the resized export. |
| [tests/persistence.rs](../tests/persistence.rs) | Public API regressions for relative paths, malformed legacy recipes and invalid export defaults; isolates process-wide path settings in a child process. |
| [tests/raw_fixtures.rs](../tests/raw_fixtures.rs) | Ignored private RAW development/export and repeated-navigation memory tests (`RAWMAKASE_FIXTURES`). |
| [tests/private_profiles.rs](../tests/private_profiles.rs) | Ignored installed/private DCP coverage (`RAWMAKASE_PROFILES`). |
| [tests/xmp_presets.rs](../tests/xmp_presets.rs) | Ignored installed XMP collection audit. |
| [catalog/private_tests.rs](../src/catalog/private_tests.rs) | Ignored private Lightroom catalog validation (`RAWMAKASE_LRCAT`). |
| [tests/data/README.md](../tests/data/README.md), [curve samples](../tests/data/lightroom-point-curves.json) | Small checked-in Lightroom point-curve reference data and its provenance. |

| [scripts/compare-preview.py](../scripts/compare-preview.py) | Compares resized sRGB previews without exposure/color fitting; distinct from the Rust comparison command. |

Use the [README's development section](../README.md#development) for the standard
suite. Private fixture checks require external data and are explicitly ignored by
default. A passing unit suite does not replace the photographic/manual checks in
the validation docs.
