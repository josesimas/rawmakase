# MIDI devices

Preferences > Automation separates **MIDI devices** from **Scripts and AI**.
MIDI input is currently available on macOS and Windows. Scripts and MCP also
work on Linux and do not need a MIDI device.

## Add a device

1. Connect your controller and open **Preferences > Automation**.
2. Under **MIDI devices**, choose **Add device** and a profile: **Loupedeck+**
   for its supplied layout, or **Custom MIDI device** for an empty mapping.
3. Give the device a name and choose its **MIDI input**. Use **Refresh inputs**
   after connecting another controller. Inputs are bound by their port identity;
   a disconnected controller is not silently replaced by another with the same name.
4. Expand **Control mappings**. Move a control to discover its CC or note number,
   or use **Add a control** to enter a number manually. Assign its parameter or action.
5. Choose each dial/slider's **Control format**. Absolute controls map 0–127 to
   the parameter range, with 64 exactly zero for bipolar parameters such as
   Exposure and Contrast. Temperature in kelvin remains linear. Relative formats support 1/127, 65/63, or 1/65 encoders.
   The Loupedeck+ profile uses 1/127; custom controls default to absolute.

Each device has its own mappings, enabled state, connection status and held
modifiers. Add more devices using the same menu, including several of one type.
One physical input can belong to only one enabled entry. Disable or remove the
old entry before assigning that input elsewhere. Ambiguous name matches are
rejected; choose a specific input to resolve them.

**Advanced connection** provides offline port-name matching, a MIDI-channel
filter (1–16 or all), relative turn speed and photo-dial detents. A photo dial
requires a relative format. **Reset mappings to profile** affects only the
selected device; a custom profile resets to an empty mapping.

MIDI controls follow the selected mask in Masking where that parameter supports
local adjustments. Other controls affect the global edit. Edits are blocked
while a dialog or blocking operation is active. Photo navigation preserves
Library/Loupe; the photo dial ignores the Library grid. Continuous parameter
controls group into one undo step until a 400 ms pause, another control/source,
or a UI edit. Different devices never share held modifiers or an undo gesture.

## Loupedeck+ profile

| Control | CC | Does |
|---|---|---|
| Exposure, Blacks, Whites | 33, 34, 35 | the slider of that name |
| Saturation, Vibrance | 36, 37 | the slider of that name |
| Temperature, Tint | 38, 39 | Temp (in mireds, clockwise is warmer) and Tint |
| Highlights, Shadows | 40, 44 | the slider of that name |
| Clarity, Contrast | 45, 46 | the slider of that name |
| Faders P1–P8 | 17–24 | Color Mixer bands Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Aqua, Blue, Purple, Magenta |
| Control Dial | 48 | previous / next photo in Develop and the Loupe |

Dials turn one point (0.01) per tick; Exposure 0.02 EV; Tint one unit.
The faders turn the channel the Color Mixer's Hue / Sat / Lum selector shows
(Hue when it shows "All"), or each band's gray mix in Black & White.
The Control Dial moves at once on the first tick of a turn, then once every
`photo_detent` (default 2) ticks.

| Button | Note | Does |
|---|---|---|
| Shift, Ctrl, Command, Alt | 66, 67, 68, 69 | held modifiers for the next button |
| Up / Left, Down / Right | 76 / 78, 77 / 79 | previous / next photo |
| P1–P5 | 80–84 | 1–5 stars |
| P6 | 85 | clear the rating (0) |
| P7, P8 | 86, 87 | pick (P), reject (X) |
| Export | 88 | Cmd+Shift+E |
| Copy, Paste | 92, 93 | Cmd+Shift+C / V (copy / paste settings) |
| Undo, Redo | 95, 96 | Cmd+Z, Cmd+Shift+Z |
| Screen Mode | 97 | J (clipping overlay) |
| Hue, Sat, Lum | 98, 99, 100 | show that channel in the Color Mixer |
| Clr/BW | 101 | Black & White on / off |
| Before After | 102 | `\` |
| C1 | 49 | Z (zoom) |
| C3–C6 | 51–54 | colour labels red, yellow, green, blue (6–9) |

Not bound: D1 (CC 41), D2 (CC 42), C2, L1–L3, Col, Fn, Tab, Custom Mode, and the
Texture and Dehaze sliders. [tools/loupedeck/controls.json](../tools/loupedeck/controls.json)
lists every control the device sends.

## Saved configuration and migration

`midi.json` in the app's data folder stores version 2 with a `devices` array.
Each entry has a stable `id`, display `name`, `enabled`, `profile` (`loupedeck` or
`custom`), `port`, optional `port_id`, `exact`, optional `channel`, and `mapping`.
Mappings are stored in full, so a custom controller never inherits Loupedeck controls.
For example, a custom absolute exposure slider on CC 7 and an Undo button on note 40:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "devices": [{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Desk controller",
    "enabled": true,
    "profile": "custom",
    "port": "Desk controller MIDI",
    "port_id": null,
    "exact": true,
    "channel": 1,
    "mapping": {
      "dials": {"7": "exposure"},
      "buttons": {"40": "undo"},
      "photo_dial": null,
      "photo_detent": 1,
      "default_encoder": "absolute",
      "encoders": {},
      "sensitivity": 1
    }
  }]
}
```

`encoders` optionally overrides the default by CC number. Formats are `absolute`,
`twos_complement`, `offset`, and `sign_magnitude`. Parameter names and button
operations are listed by `rawmakase control capabilities`. Buttons also support
legacy shortcut notation and held modifiers such as `hold:shift`.

An existing unversioned `midi.json` becomes one Loupedeck-profile device,
retaining port matching, mapping overrides, unassigned controls and photo-dial
settings. It is written as version 2 when settings are next changed. A fresh
installation starts with no devices. Invalid or unsupported configuration files
are left intact and reported in Preferences.

`automation.json` stores script/MCP access independently. An existing legacy
`socket` preference is honored only when `automation.json` does not exist.
Enabling scripts does not add a device, and removing devices does not stop MCP.

## Scripts and AI

Enable **Scripts and AI > Allow local scripts and applications** in Preferences.
See [External control](automation.md) for the CLI and [MCP setup](mcp.md) for Codex
and other MCP clients. Semantic `set`, `turn` and named `action` commands are
independent of MIDI mappings. Legacy `dial`/`press` commands retain the bundled
Loupedeck layout in a separate compatibility adapter; they do not borrow any
physical device's mappings or modifier state.

## Mapping another device

[tools/loupedeck](../tools/loupedeck) has the scripts used to map the Loupedeck+:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r tools/loupedeck/requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python tools/loupedeck/capture.py     # print every message
.venv/bin/python tools/loupedeck/mapper.py      # operate a control, name it
.venv/bin/python tools/loupedeck/probe.py "Fader P1"   # report one gesture
```

They write `capture.jsonl`, `mapping.json` and `probes.jsonl` to the current
directory.

The built-in profile uses Loupedeck+ names. Preferences also lists configured
controls and the last received unknown CC/note so other device numbers can be
mapped. The MIDI backend is available on macOS and Windows; it currently accepts
the relative encoder encoding documented above, not absolute-position faders.
